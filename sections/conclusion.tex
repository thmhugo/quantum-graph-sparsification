Having arrived to \autoref{th:raf-spectral-sparisifaction}, the main result of
the paper was made explicit. Apers and de Wolf's algorithm thus yields a
quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of
cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.

This result can probably be combined with recent classical results such as
\cite{chen_maximum_2022} to yield even faster algorithms. Stay tuned...
